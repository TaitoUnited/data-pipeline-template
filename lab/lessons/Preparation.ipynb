    "While executing the lessons you are making some changes to the project implementation. If you want to push these changes to a shared git repository, create a separate git branch for yourself so that your changes won't get mixed up with others. You can create a personal feature branch either with git or by running `taito feat: my-name`.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the lessons you run taito commands that target your local environment. However, if cloud environments are already up and running, you can optionally target them with an additional `:ENV` prefix. For example, `taito open bucket` opens a bucket located in your local environment and `taito open bucket:ENV` opens a bucket located in *ENV* environment. Here *ENV* is `dev`, `test`, `stag`, or `prod`.\n",

    "## Example database\n",
    "\n",
    "The lessons require some database tables and example data. You can create them like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Copy all files from **lab/lessons/files/db/** to **database/**. If a file already exists, add contents at the end of the existing file. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```shell\n",
    "    cp -rnv lab/lessons/files/db/* database/\n",
    "    cat lab/lessons/files/db/sqitch.plan >> database/sqitch.plan\n",
    "    cat lab/lessons/files/db/data/dev.sql >> database/data/dev.sql\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Initialize your database with the example tables and data by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```shell\n",
    "    taito init --clean\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Continue\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you are ready to continue with [the lessons](Contents.ipynb). Start from the basics."
