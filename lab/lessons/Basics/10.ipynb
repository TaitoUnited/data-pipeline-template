    "# Basics 10: Real implementation and project configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "So far you have executed all code within Jupyter Lab. In this lesson we modify the real implementation located at the **worker/src** folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Review the example implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open the files **worker/execute** and **worker/src/examples/job** in your code editor to see their contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Execute the implementation inside the worker container by running `taito exec:worker ./execute job`.\n",
    "\n",
    "TIP: You can also execute the **job.py** implementation directly with `taito exec:worker python3 src/examples/job.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Review the ways to execute your implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple ways to execute your implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Webhook:** Trigger you implementation based on an incoming http request (TODO: add an example for this).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Continuous:** Start your implementation in **worker/src/server.py** as a separate thread, and it will run continuously. This is good for listening events, for example storage bucket uploads.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Scheduled:** Add a cron job schedule in **scripts/helm.yaml**. This is good for task that need to be run periodically, for example once a week. Note that cron jobs are run on Kubernetes only. You can find more info on cron job scheduling at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron and https://crontab.guru. Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "    worker:\n",
    "      ...\n",
    "      cronJobs:\n",
    "        - name: print-random\n",
    "          schedule: \"0 2 * * *\"\n",
    "          concurrencyPolicy: Forbid # Forbid or Allow\n",
    "          args:\n",
    "            - ./execute\n",
    "            - COMMAND\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Manual:** Execute implementation manually with `taito exec:worker:ENV ./execute COMMAND`. This is good for tasks that only need to be run occasionally, for example creating a new Power BI push dataset or refreshing an existing Power BI dataset schema. You can also use this for retrying automatic operations that have failed.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Custom Taito CLI command:** You can make a [custom Taito CLI command](https://taitounited.github.io/taito-cli/docs/09-custom-commands) that runs the `taito exec:worker:ENV ./execute COMMAND` command for you. For example `taito powerbi refresh`. This makes it easier to execute manual operations that need to be executed often.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Add your own implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you know all the basics, you should create your own implemention at the **worker/src** folder and make it work on the local environment first. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Stop the containers, checkout another Git branch that does not include the changes you made during the lessons, and start containers again with `taito start --clean`.\n",
    "2. Add some dimension tables and one fact table to your database. This was explained in [lesson 3](03.ipynb).\n",
    "3. Add an implementation that updates dimension table data by reading CSV files located in a storage bucket. This was explained in lessons [1](01.ipynb) and [2](02.ipynb).\n",
    "4. Add an implementation that updates the fact table data by reading CSV files located in a storage bucket. This was explained in lessons [1](01.ipynb) and [2](02.ipynb).\n",
    "5. Trigger the aforementioned implementations either by continuous, scheduled, or manual execution. This was explained in [lesson 10](10.ipynb).\n",
    "6. Optional: If you use Apache Superset for visualizations, create a dataset view and dashboard on Apache Superset. This was explained in lessons [4](04.ipynb) and [5](05.ipynb).\n",
    "7. Optional: If you use Power BI Service for visualizations, add implemention for Power BI visualizations and integration as was explained in lessons [7](07.ipynb), [8](08.ipynb), and [9](09.ipynb). Make a custom Taito CLI commands for creating and refreshing the Power BI dataset as was explained in [lesson 10](10.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4: Create cloud environments\n",
    "\n",
    "Create development and production environments according to the **scripts/taito/CONFIGURATION.md** instructions, unless somebody has already done that.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find additional instructions in markdown files located at **scripts/taito**. **CONFIGURATION.md** contains instructions for configuring your project, creating remote cloud environments, adding containers, adding storage buckets, setting user permissions, etc. **DEVELOPMENT.md** contains the most important Taito CLI commands that you should know and some additional development instructions.\n"
